# TextToAudioSynthesis
A Python script for text-to-audio synthesis using AWS Polly and Google Cloud Storage. The script splits the input text, converts it into audio chunks, and uploads the synthesized audio to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. It demonstrates how to use cloud services for text-to-speech conversion and storage.

Instructions:
1. Replace 'Your/Relative/Path/to/FileName.json' with the relative path to your Google Cloud Storage JSON key file.
2. Customize the 'Your Text Here' placeholder with your desired input text.
3. Set your AWS access key and secret key as environment variables.
4. Run the script to synthesize the text and upload the audio to Google Cloud Storage.
